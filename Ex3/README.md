## *This project deals with directional weighted graph in python, we used two interfaces to implement the graph properties in the class.*

- *GraphInterface.py*

This interface represents an directional weighted graph. the class that implements the interface is DiGraph. in this class, the functions of the actions on the graph are implemented, such as adding a node, deleting a node,add edge , deleting a edge, and more.. The main data structure that we chose to use to implement the project is dictionary.


- *GraphAlgoInterface.py*

This interface represents the "regular" Graph Theory algorithms including:
load, save, tsp, center, shortestpath (Explanations in wiki)

## How To Run


- *First Method:*

Download the project, open the project and run the main.py class or the tests classes in the tests directory.

- *Second Method:*

Download the project, open cmd / terminal, use the cd command to change directory to src folder for example:

`cd "your path"`

now type:

`python main.py`

## *Algorithms that we have used*

- [*TSP (Traveling Salesman Problem*)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Travelling_salesman_problem)

- [*Dijkstra*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dijkstra%27s_algorithm)

- [*strongly connected components*](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/check-if-a-directed-graph-is-connected-or-not/)

## *UML*
